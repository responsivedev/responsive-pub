 * An add-on for a special kind of remote table that supports epoch-based fencing

 * <p>
 * TODO: does it make sense to refactor this so it integrates with the EOS Mongo
 *  table, which uses an epoch per write rather than per table-partition like C*
 *  Similarly, we might want/need to split off the stream-time functionality 
 *  into a separate interface or completely pull it into the RemoteWindowedTable
 *  class for two reasons: for when we persist the stream-time in the remote
 *  table, and for the eventual MongoDB-based window store implementation.
