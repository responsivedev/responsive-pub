### 2.1 Trial License

(a) During the Trial Period, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to (i) install and use the Software,
including both object code and Source Code access as specified below, on Licensee’s internal server
in the country to which such Software is delivered; (ii) use the Software for evaluation purposes;

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the purchase of a Commercial
License Key, Licensor grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during
the Term, without the right to sublicense, to install and use the Software, including both object code

The license fees, and, if applicable, maintenance and support fees, will be
specified at the time of purchase. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise specified.

### 3.2 Payment

Payment for a Commercial License Key must be made in full at the time of
purchase. Any additional invoices must be paid within thirty (30) days of receipt. Failure to comply
with the payment terms may result in suspension of access to the Licensed Software until all
outstanding payments are received.

## 4. Cloud  Services Integration

### 4.1 Relationship of Services

This License governs your use of the Software. Cloud
Services are governed by separate Cloud Services Terms available at
https://www.responsive.dev/responsive-cloud-terms-of-service . When using both the Software and
Cloud Services, each agreement applies independently. The Software may be used on its own or in
conjunction with Cloud Services. Your rights to use the Software are not dependent on using Cloud
Services.

### 4.2 Independent Operation

Purchasing a Software license does not require the use of
Cloud Services, and purchasing Cloud Services does not grant additional rights to the Software.
Each product is licensed and sold independently, with separate pricing and terms.

### 4.3 Termination Effects

Termination or expiration of Cloud Services does not affect
your Software license, and termination of your Software license does not affect your Cloud Services
subscription. However, breach of either agreement may, at Licensor’s discretion, constitute grounds
for termination of both. Compliance with both agreements is required when using both products.

### 4.4 Data and Integration

Data processed by the Software may be transmitted to Cloud
Services when configured. You are responsible for configuring and managing integration features,
as well as ensuring the security and privacy of data transmission between the Software and Cloud
Services.

### 4.5 Service Levels

Any service levels for Cloud Services are specified in the Cloud
Services Terms. The performance of the Software is independent of Cloud Services availability.
Licensor is not responsible for issues arising from the interaction between the Software and Cloud
Services. Cloud Services uptime does not guarantee Software functionality and vice versa.

## 5. Compliance Verification

You must maintain reasonable processes to track: (a) Source
Code access and usage; (b) Compliance with Trial Period limitations; (c) Commercial License Key
usage.

## 6. Ownership

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor or its licensors own and shall
retain all proprietary rights, title and interest, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, know-
how, design rights, trademark, and other intellectual property rights, in and to the Licensed
Materials and any changes, corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates and other modifications
thereto (collectively, “Modifications”), whether made by or on behalf of Licensee, Licensor or any
third party, and as between the parties all such rights shall vest in and be assigned to Licensor.
Licensee acknowledges that the license granted under this Agreement does not provide Licensee
with title to or ownership of the Licensed Materials, but only a right of limited use under the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee shall keep the Licensed Materials free and clear of all
claims, liens and encumbrances. In the event ownership of any Licensed Materials or Modifications
vest in Licensee, Licensee hereby assigns to Licensor all of its right, title and interest in and to all
intellectual property and other rights (and where relevant such assignment is by present assignment
of future copyright) in such Licensed Materials or Modifications, and waives any and all moral
rights in such Licensed Materials or Modifications to which it may now or in the future be entitled
under the laws of any jurisdiction.

## 7. Confidentiality

Licensee agrees that all material and information relating to the Licensed
Materials is made available for use solely under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Software License Agreement. Licensee has no right at any time during or after cancellation or
termination of this Software License Agreement to disclose such material and/or information
relating to the Licensed Materials, whether directly or indirectly, to any third-party without
Licensor’s prior written approval. Licensee shall hold harmless, defend, and indemnify Licensor
from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, and expenses arising out of or in connection
with Licensee&#39;s failure to comply with requirements of this Section 7.

### 7.1 Opt-Out Metrics Collection

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor may collect certain usage metrics and information
related to Licensee's use of the Licensed Materials, including but not limited to the number of
API calls, feature utilization, performance data, and device information (collectively, "Usage
Metrics"). Usage Metrics will be collected by Licensor for the purpose of billing, product
improvement, and analysis of adoption trends. Licensee may opt out of this Usage Metrics collection
by providing written notice to Licensor.

### 7.2 Usage-Based Licensing

If Licensee has purchased a usage-based license for the Licensed Materials, Licensee is required to
provide the Usage Metrics specified by Licensor. Licensee agrees to transmit such Usage Metrics to
Licensor on a regular basis as required under the terms of the usage-based license. Licensee
acknowledges that continued use of the Licensed Materials under a usage-based license is
contingent on Licensee's compliance with this Usage Metrics reporting requirement, and that
Licensee may not opt out of Usage Metrics collection in this case.


## 8. Limited Warranty

There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Software License
Agreement. Consequently, Licensor provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the limited
warranty provided to Licensee hereunder. Licensee will be solely responsible for the development
of the applications authorized by this Software License Agreement and for providing all support or
services required or requested by end users of the applications. Licensee will not make any
representations or warranties to its employees, customers, end users or any other third-party on
Licensor’s behalf. Licensor assumes no responsibility under this Software License Agreement,
either directly or indirectly, for damages to Licensee or third parties resulting from the direct or
indirect use of the applications created by or on behalf of Licensee.

## 9. Infringement

Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns against any damages, losses, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from any third-party action to the extent based upon a
claim that the Software infringes any copyright or trademark or misappropriates any trade secret, to
the extent that such claim is based on any of the following: (a) any method or process in which the
Software may be used; (b) compliance with Licensee’s specifications; (c) use of Software other than
a current unaltered release of the Software; or (d) the combination, operation or use of the Software
with non-Licensor programs or data, except where such combination, operation, or use is explicitly
intended or recommended by Licensor.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

THE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR FOR ALL
CLAIMS RELATING TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY CAUSE OF ACTION SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT,
OR STRICT LIABILITY, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALL FEES PAID
TO LICENSOR HEREUNDER. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO APPLY
WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. LICENSOR
SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF DATA OR DOCUMENTATION, IT BEING
UNDERSTOOD THAT LICENSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REASONABLE BACK-UP
PRECAUTIONS. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF
PROFITS; ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES;
OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEMANDS BROUGHT AGAINST LICENSEE, EVEN IF LICENSOR
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIMS OR DEMANDS. THIS
LIMITATION UPON DAMAGES AND CLAIMS IS INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT
REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. LICENSEE
MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER CERTAIN LAWS (E.G., CONSUMER LAWS)
THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF SUCH LAWS APPLY,
CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE; HOWEVER,
ALL OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

## 11. Term and Termination

### 11.1 Term

The term of this Software License Agreement will begin as of the date that Licensee

### 11.2 Termination for Convenience

During the Trial Period, Licensor may terminate this Software License Agreement at any time.

### 11.3 Termination for Cause

Licensor may terminate this Software License Agreement at
if Licensee breaches its obligations hereunder. Licensor will affect such termination by giving
Licensee notice of termination, specifying therein the alleged breach. If the breach is curable,
Licensee will have a grace period of thirty (30) days after such notice is served to cure the breach
described therein. If the breach is cured within the thirty (30) day grace period, then this Software
License Agreement will remain in effect; otherwise, this Software License Agreement will
automatically terminate upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day grace period.

## 12 Effect of Termination

Upon termination of the Software License Agreement for any
reason the following terms shall apply: (a) all rights granted under this Software License Agreement
will immediately terminate and Licensee must immediately stop all use of the Licensed Materials;
(b) Licensee must return to Licensor or destroy all copies of the Licensed Materials provided to or
made by or on behalf of Licensee, and will, within ten (10) days after the effective date of
termination, provide Licensor with written certification that all such copies have been returned or
destroyed; and (c) all provisions of this Software License Agreement with the exception of the
licenses granted hereunder will survive termination of this Software License Agreement for any
reason. Termination of the Software License Agreement will not affect Licensee’s obligation to pay
all amounts accrued hereunder prior to the effective date of termination. Licensee agrees that the
termination of this Software License Agreement by Licensor can never entail liability for Licensor
to pay damages to Licensee for anticipated or missing profits that could otherwise have arisen
through Licensee&#39;s use of the License.

## 13 Miscellaneous

### 13.1 Severability
If any term or provision of the Software License Agreement is found to
be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, then, that provision notwithstanding, the
Software License Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and in such event, such provision
will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or
invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.

### 13.2 Governing Law/Forum Selection
This Software License Agreement and any claim,
cause of action or dispute arising out of, or related thereto, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of Licensee’s country of origin or
where Licensee uses the licenses from, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, which
would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Any
dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of, connected with, or relating to this Software License
Agreement, the Licensed Software, or any use related thereto, will be submitted to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court located in State of California.

### 13.3 No Joint Venture

Nothing contained in the Software License Agreement will be
construed so as to make the parties partners or joint venturers or to permit either party to bind the
other party to any agreement or purport to act on behalf of the other party in any respect.

### 13.4 Waiver and Modifications
No amendment or modification of this Software License
Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights hereunder, will be effective unless assented to in a writing
signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Any such waiver will be narrowly construed to
apply only to the specific provision and under the specific circumstances for which it was given and
will not apply with respect to any repeated or continued violation of the same provision or any other
provision. No other course of dealing between or among any of the parties to this Software License
Agreement or any delay in exercising any rights pursuant to this Software License Agreement will
operate as a waiver of any rights of any party to this Software License Agreement. Except as
expressly provided in this Software License Agreement, no party who is not a party to this Software
License Agreement will have any right or obligation pursuant to this Software License Agreement.

### 13.5 Import/Export Law
Licensee may not import, use, or otherwise export or re-export
the Licensed Materials except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in
which the Licensed Materials were obtained.

### 13.6 Federal Government End Use Provisions

Licensor may provide the Licensed
Materials for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with the following:
Government technical data and software rights related to the Licensed Materials include only those

7015 (Technical Data - Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial
Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). If a government agency has a need for
rights not conveyed under these terms, it must negotiate with Licensor to determine if there are
acceptable terms for transferring such rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum
specifically conveying such rights.

### 13.7 Assignment

This Software License Agreement, or any of your rights and obligations
under this Software License Agreement, cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in
part, and any such attempted assignment or transfer by Licensee in violation of the foregoing will be
null and void.

hereunder, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes and cancels any prior and contemporaneous oral or written proposals,
promises, or agreements. There are no promises, covenants, or undertakings other than those
