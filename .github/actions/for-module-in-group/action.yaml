##
# Executes a given action on all modules with a specified group, where a
# "module group" is defined as a set of modules with direct dependencies
# on each other. Module groups are defined by a single, shared version.
#
# Module groups may contain 1 or more modules, and are named after the
# "root" module in the dependency tree (if one exists). Practically
# speaking, they should be named after the module where the version of
# the entire group is originally defined.
#
# The current groups with more than one module are defined below
#
# root: kafka-client
#  - responsive-test-utils
#
#
# TODO: figure out if we can pass action names directly as input so we
#       don't have to hard-code the mapping like we do now.
#       Something like this does not seem to work:
#
#       uses: ./.github/actions/${{ inputs.action }}
#
#       We may be able to use a strategy matrix to more cleanly define
#       the module groups if/when this becomes overly complex or error
#       prone
